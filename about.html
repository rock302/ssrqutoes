      Rajput's personal relationships have been the subject of widespread media
      attention.[156][157] In 2011, Rajput publicly proposed to his Pavitra
      Rishta co-star Ankita Lokhande during a national broadcast of the dance
      competition show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa;[32] both of them had participated in
      the show as competing contestants.[158] The couple began dating after
      their first meeting on the set of Pavitra Rishta, where they had been cast
      as husband and wife to each other.[159] In 2012, they began living
      together,[160] and reports of an imminent marriage between the two
      occasionally cropped up in the media.[161] In an interview, Rajput stated
      that marriage and cohabitation were no different and that it was
      hypocritical to treat the former as sacred and the latter as a
      crime.[162][163] At an event, he had said, "I am very transparent about my
      relationships. I mean I will not hesitate to say that I am in a
      relationship"..
