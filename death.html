      On 14 June 2020, Rajput, aged 34, was found dead, hanging from the ceiling
      fan[1] in his home in Bandra, Mumbai.[184] He had reportedly shown signs
      of clinical depression and was suffering from bipolar
      disorder.[185][186][187] The Mumbai Police commenced an investigation,
      stating that the death was being treated as a suicide.[188] The postmortem
      report stated that the cause of death was "asphyxia due to hanging,"[189]
      and called it a "clear case of suicide."[190] The autopsy doctors placed
      the time of death at 10 to 12 hours before postmortem examination on 14
      June at 11:30 p.m.â€”meaning between 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. (Indian
      Standard Time).[191] No foul play was found.[192] The viscera report
      likewise ruled out foul play.[193] On 25 July, Rajput's family lodged a
      first information report with police in Patna, where his father lives,
      accusing Rhea Chakraborty and five others of abetment of suicide.
