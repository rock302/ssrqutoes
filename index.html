      During his course at the Delhi College of Engineering, Rajput enrolled
      himself in Shiamak Davar's dance classes.[9] Soon afterward, he also began
      attending acting classes under the theatre director Barry John.[17][18]
      Rajput later stated that he found the experience to be liberating and
      wanted to continue doing it forever.[19] He featured as a background
      dancer in the Dhoom Again song of Dhoom 2 and in Aishwarya Rai's
      performance at the closing ceremony of the 2006 Commonwealth Games.[20] In
      2006, he dropped out of his engineering course during his fourth year to
      begin a career in arts and performance.[21][22] He moved to Mumbai, took
      up odd jobs and small roles alongside working in the theatre industry.[23]
      Rajput eventually joined Nadira Babbar's theatre group called the Ekjute
      in which he remained for two and a half years..

    <p>
      Raabta was released on 9 June 2017,[92] which subsequently received mixed
      reviews from critics and ended up a flop in the box office, unable to
      recover its large production cost.[93] It was a time transcending love
      story,[94] where Sushant Singh Rajput played the role of two characters
      who were reincarnations of each other.[95] While the filming was primarily
      carried out in the city of Budapest, Hungary, in the Indian state of
      Punjab and in the island country of Mauritius.
